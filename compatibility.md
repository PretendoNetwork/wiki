# Overview
Here, you can find information about what titles / features Pretendo is currently able to support, and what isn't supported at this time.

# Web-Based Aspects
## Account System
The account backend is mostly functional - the Wii U can create and delete accounts, while the 3ds can only create. Certain items such as changing account settings haven't been implemented. Since the account creation system is moving to the website, some of these features may not be available on console.
