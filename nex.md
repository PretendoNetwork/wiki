<!-- SUBTITLE: Overview & documentation on Nintendo's semi-proprietary networking library. -->

# Overview
From **Kinnay**'s documentation (https://github.com/Kinnay/NintendoClients/wiki/):
> Nintendo offers a networking library called NEX.
>
> NEX provides functions to connect and talk to game servers. Nintendo hasn't written it from scratch. It's based on Quazal Rendez-Vous, so some things like the PRUDP Protocol may be seen in other games that use Quazal.
